# Project 4
- **Assigned: Friday March 6**
- **Task 0 Due: Friday March 20, 11:59pm**
- **Task 1&2 Due: Friday April 3, 11:59pm**

##### Project Topics: Mobile to Cloud application

This project has 3 tasks:
- Task 0 involves researching, selecting, and demonstrating using a 3rd party API that you will use in Task 1&2, and writing and reading from a nosql-database-as-a-service.
- Task 1 will build on the Deploying to the Cloud Lab and the Android Lab. You will design and build a simple mobile application that will communicate with a RESTful web service in the cloud.
- Task 2 will add an operations logging and analysis function to your Task 1 web service.

When completing these tasks, the student should reflect on synchronous and asynchronous calls, event handling, remote interfaces, mobile and cloud computing.

##### Task 0 Demonstrate using a 3rd Party API and MongoDB-as-a-Service

Research and choose a 3rd party API to use in Task 1 and 2.  Be sure to read Task 1 carefully to see how you will use the API, and to understand what APIs cannot be used.
In detail, you should satisfy the following requirements:
1.	Fetch data from a 3rd party API
1.1.	Create a simple Java application that will make a request to the API and receive structured JSON or XML data.  
1.2.	Extract some piece of data and print it to the console.
2.	Write and read data to MongoDB Atlas
2.1.	Read the Database section in Task 2 about creating and using mongoDB with Atlas.   
2.2.	Create a mongoDB database on Atlas.
2.3.	Create (another) simple Java application that will:
2.3.1.	Prompt the user for a string.
2.3.2.	Write the string as part of a document to the mongoDB database.
2.3.3.	Read all documents currently stored in the database.
2.3.4.	Print all strings contained in these documents to the console.
3.	Create a document that contains:
3.1.	Your name and Andrew ID
3.2.	The name of the API (e.g. Flickr)
3.3.	The URL of the API documentation (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
3.4.	A short description (1-3 sentences) of what your mobile application will do with the information from the API (e.g. My mobile app will prompt the user for a string and then search Flickr using their API to display an interesting picture tagged with that string.)
3.5.	A screenshot of the console output from section 1.2.
3.6.	A screenshot of the console output from section 2.3.4
4.	Submit your document (only) to Canvas as a pdf by the Task 0 deadline.
Do not submit your code. It will be integrated into Task 2 and 3.
Grading:
•	Task 0 complete and submitted on time: Bonus 5 points
•	Task 1 does not use the API demonstrated in Task 0:  Penalty 10 points
(Small print to head off lots of questions on Piazza:  If you don’t submit Task 0 on time, you get no bonus points.  If you have not committed to an API by submitting Task 0 by the deadline, you can’t be penalized for not using that API.  If you do not use the API submitted in Task 0 on time, you still get the 5 bonus points, but are penalized 10 points, resulting in a net penalty of 5 points. Grace days cannot be used for Task 0.  Grace days, if you have some remaining, can be used for Tasks 1 and 2. No purchase necessary. Limit one winner per household. Offer void in NJ, TX, and Jaynestown.)
